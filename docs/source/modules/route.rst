Usage
*****

First you will have to know about **route-matching**.

The module somehow needs to link the configured and existing routes to manage them.

You can to set how this matching is done by setting the 'match_fields' parameter!

The default behaviour is that a route is matched by its 'gateway' and 'network'.

However - it is **recommended** to use/set 'description' as **unique identifier** if many routes are used.
